# rLoop-numsim-SLIM

MATLAB script for Single-sided Linear Induction Motor for rLoop rPod Hyperloop pod design

## Running the code

Open SLIM.m in MATLAB editor, and locate variable
```
tableno = 54;
```

Change 'tableno' to suit the corresponding design case, e.g., a 'tableno' of 54 corresponds to Table 5-4 in the original thesis doc.
