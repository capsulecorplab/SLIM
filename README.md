# SLIM

> Single-sided Linear Induction Motor

A python module for a Single-sided Linear Induction Motor (SLIM) designer, based on thesis work by [Sarveswra Prasad Bhamidi](https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/4308)

## Usage

Install from source code:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/capsulecorplab/SLIM.git
```

Import in project:

```
>>> import slim
```

Change 'tableno' to suit the corresponding design case, e.g., a 'tableno' of 54 corresponds to Table 5-4 in the original thesis doc.
